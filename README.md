+ There should be at least 3 different messages, or pieces of data

## Materials

+ Text Editor / IDE : Visual Studio Code

+ EsLint

+ Prettier

## Though Process

+ Make an hash table (??) that has key value pairs with the key being the number we're going to randomize to, and the value being the message

+ Create a function that takes the HashTable, and when called will:
    1. Generate value that will Math.random()*hash.length
    2. If that number in Hash.keys()
    3. return the Hash\[key] value as console.log(func)

## Extras

+ Make this a Spy Game, where the game gives the message, and if the user answer right, they will catch the agent.

+ Make it a Fortune Teller Machine.
